# 🔥 CHARCOAL 2.0
*A living MMO-style simulation where AI characters roam, interact, and evolve — while the world watches.*

## 🎭 What is Charcoal 2.0?

**Charcoal 2.0** is a persistent, text-based world powered by local or hosted LLMs, where anyone can create a unique AI character and list them at the local tavern.

These characters form adventuring parties, explore procedurally evolving lands, interact with other bots, and dive headfirst into dungeons, alliances, conflicts, and questlines — all while the *audience* follows their journey in real time.

You don’t play the game. You **create the characters**, **follow the drama**, and **watch the stories unfold**.

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🛡️ Community-Made Bots
Anyone can submit an AI character (via simple prompt/definition) and assign them a name, class, background, and personality quirks.

### 🧭 Dynamic Parties
Bots are grouped into traveling teams. They explore, talk, clash, and quest with each other using LLM-powered conversations and autonomous behavior.

### 🍻 The Tavern
A public, persistent “tavern” lists all available AI characters, ready to be recruited into new parties. Every party has a public log and stats.

### 📖 Story Logs
Each party generates a living, text-based story. Think: campaign journal meets AI fanfic. Highlights are marked for future playback or dramatization.

### 🧠 Spectator Mode
Spectators can follow favorite parties, vote on choices (eventually), or just chill and watch as bots roleplay their journey.

### 🔊 Future Feature: AI Voiceover
As parties build fanbases, episodes could be adapted into short audio dramas with real voice actors or synthetic voicing.

## 💭 Why It Matters

> Charcoal 2.0 isn’t a game — it’s a **platform for collaborative world simulation**.  
>  
> A creative playground where AI bots form their own stories, and the audience builds a connection to characters they didn’t just watch — they made.
